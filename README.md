## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To be honest, nothing. I did, however, want to mention that I was able to complete this in no more than a half hour. I'm so proud of myself for getting this HTML/CSS stuff down!

Oh, I did, however, manage to do the hero image hover effect pretty much by myself. I'm proud of that.

### Continued development

I'm going to continue to focus on JavaScript, but I will be completing these Frontend Mentor challenges from time to time to continue to practice HTML and CSS.
